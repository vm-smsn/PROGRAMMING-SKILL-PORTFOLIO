w1 = "Coding" #This would be the first variable.
w2 = "is"     #This is the second variable that we're gonna be using.
w3 = "Fun"    #And this would be the last variable that will be used.

print(w1 + " " + w2 + " " + w3)
#The code above prints the variables as per the instructions.
#The quotation marks are there to represent the space between the words. 
#The addition symbol acts as an concatenation operation.
