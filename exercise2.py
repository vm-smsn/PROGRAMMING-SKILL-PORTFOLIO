num1 = 8   # num1 is a variable that is assigned with the value 8
num2 = 10  # num2 is a variable that is assidned with the value 10
# We now have our variables it's time to calculate the sum.

sum = num1 + num2
# The sum function adds values within the variables.

# It is time to print the calculated sum
print ("The sum of", num1, "&", num2, "is =", sum)
